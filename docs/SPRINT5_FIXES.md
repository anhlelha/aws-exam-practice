# SPRINT 5: Fix Multi-Select & Review Logic

## Goal
Fix the critical issue where "Multiple Choice" questions do not allow selecting multiple answers in the Practice UI. This will be implemented following the strict `sprint-planning` workflow, ensuring UI validation via mockups first.

## High-Level Tasks
1.  **Mockup Update:** defining the visual state for multi-selected answers.
2.  **Frontend Fix:** Update `Practice.tsx` to handle `is_multiple_choice` logic correctly.
3.  **Backend Verification:** Ensure `is_multiple_choice` flag is correctly propagated.

## Dependencies
- None.
